## Trends

<br><br>
This folder contains code for estimating temperature trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, and the Theil-Sen Slope Estimator (TSSE) / Mann-Kendall (MK) test method. 
The scripts cannot be run stand-alone, instead they contain snippets of code that may be useful as-is or adapted for a user's particular needs. 
<br><br>
Refer to 'TEMPM.yml' to see a list of the python packages that were installed when writing/using this code. If you get any errors, it might in some instances be because you are using a different version of a particular python package. 

#### EEMD_trends_uncertainty_confidence.m

Code examples for estimating trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, as well as code examples for getting uncertainty and confidence. The functions used to get the time series used to estimate uncertainty and confidence/significance of EEMD trends are provided in 'TrendFunctions.py'. 

#### get_TSSEMK_trends.py

Code to estimate the trend using the combined Theil-Sen Slope Estimator and Mann-Kendall test (TSSE) method. 

#### TrendFunctions.py

A python script that contains a selection of functions useful for estimating trends following the methods described by Hemming et al., (2023).

For example, functions that are useful for:

* Time conversion between MATLAB, numpy datetime64 and python datetime
* Selecting and binning temperatures in time and depth
* Deseasoning the tempeature data
* Calculating simple climatologies
* Filling gaps in the temperature time series
* Get simulated brown noise simulations for estimating significance
* Get downsampling time series for estimating uncertainty

## Climatology

<br><br>
This folder contains code used to calculate a climatology following the method described by Hemming et al., (2020) and Roughan et al., (2022). 

#### create_climatology.m

This is the main function used to calculate the climatology statistics for a variable, which has been used for temperature and salinity so far. The user can define a bottle to mooring ratio, a time-centred window length when calculating the statistics, and the smoothing window length as a final step (as described by Hemming et al., 2020).

Refer to 'Example_climatology.m' to see usage examples. 

#### Example_climatology.m

This script contains code examples using the 'create_climatology.m' function above. Two climatologies are created: one using all data platforms over the whole time period, and one using satellite data only since 2009 only. The climatologies are created using data from the Port Hacking 100m site, using the NetCDF file: 'PH100_TEMP_1953-2020_aggregated_v1.nc' available here: https://thredds.aodn.org.au/thredds/catalog/UNSW/NRS_climatology/Temperature_DataProducts/PH100/Aggregated/catalog.html and which is also provided in this repository.

#### load_netCDF.m

This is a function that loads in all data variables and metadata from a NetCDF file. But keep in mind that this function uses 'eval', which although useful in this instance, is not generally recommended by Mathworks.
