## Trends

<br><br>
This folder contains code for estimating temperature trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, and the Theil-Sen Slope Estimator (TSSE) / Mann-Kendall (MK) combined method. 
The scripts do not run stand-alone. Rather they contain snippets of code that can be copied and adapted for a user's particular needs.  
<br><br>
Refer to 'TEMPM.yml' to see a list of python packages contained in the environment when developing this code. If you get any errors, it's possibly because you are using a different version of a particular python package. 

### MATLAB

#### EEMD_trend.m

This is the function used to estimate the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) temperature trends. 

#### EEMD_trends_uncertainty_confidence.m

Code used to estimate trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, as well as for getting uncertainty and confidence. Downsampling and brown noise time series created to estimate uncertainty and significance, respectively, are provided in 'TrendFunctions.py'. 

### Python

#### get_TSSEMK_trends.py

Code to estimate the trend using the combined Theil-Sen Slope Estimator and Mann-Kendall test (TSSE) method. 

#### TrendFunctions.py

A python script that contains a selection of functions used in the methods described by Hemming et al., (2023).

For example, this script contains functions that are useful for:

* Time conversion between MATLAB, numpy datetime64 and python datetime
* Selecting and binning temperatures in time and depth
* Deseasoning the tempeature data
* Calculating simple climatologies
* Filling gaps in the temperature time series
* Creating simulated brown noise simulations for estimating significance
* Creating downsampling time series for estimating uncertainty

This script was typically imported as a 'package' using the following code:
```
import TrendFunctions as TF
```
<br><br>
## Climatology

<br><br>
This folder contains code used to calculate a climatology following the method described by Hemming et al., (2020) and Roughan et al., (2022). 

#### create_climatology.m

This is the main function used to calculate the climatology statistics for a variable, which has been used for temperature. The user can define a bottle to mooring ratio, a time-centred window length when calculating the statistics, and the smoothing window length as a final step (as described by Hemming et al., 2020).

Refer to 'Example_climatology.m' to see usage examples. 

#### Example_climatology.m

This script contains code examples using the 'create_climatology.m' function above. Two climatologies are created: one using all data platforms over the whole time period, and one using satellite data only since 2009. The example climatologies are created using data from the Port Hacking 100m site, using the NetCDF file: 'PH100_TEMP_1953-2020_aggregated_v1.nc' available here: https://thredds.aodn.org.au/thredds/catalog/UNSW/NRS_climatology/Temperature_DataProducts/PH100/Aggregated/catalog.html (also provided in this repository).

#### load_netCDF.m

This is a function that loads in all data variables and metadata from a NetCDF file. But the user should keep in mind that this function uses 'eval' which is not recommended by Mathworks.
