## Contents

### Trends

This folder contains code for estimating temperature trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, and the Theil-Sen Slope Estimator (TSSE) / Mann-Kendall (MK) test method. 
The scripts cannot be run stand-alone, but they contain snippets of code that may be useful as-is or adapted. 

#### EEMD_trends_uncertainty_confidence.m

Code examples for estimating trends using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, as well as code examples for getting uncertainty and confidence. The functions used to get the time series used to estimate uncertainty and confidence/significance of EEMD trends are provided in 'TrendFunctions.py'. 

#### get_TSSEMK_trends.py

Code to estimate the trend using the combined Theil-Sen Slope Estimator and Mann-Kendall test (TSSE) method. 

#### TrendFunctions.py

A python script that contains a selection of functions useful for estimating trends following the methods described by Hemming et al., (2023).

For example, functions that are useful for:

* Time conversion between MATLAB, numpy datetime64 and python datetime
* Selecting and binning temperatures in time and depth
* Deseasoning the tempeature data
* Calculating simple climatologies
* Filling gaps in the temperature time series
* Get simulated brown noise simulations for estimating significance
* Get downsampling time series for estimating uncertainty

### Climatology

#### create_climatology.m

This is the main function used to calculate the climatology statistics for a variable, which has been used for temperature and salinity so far. The user can define a bottle to mooring ratio, a time-centred window length when calculating the statistics, and the smoothing window length as a final step (as described by Hemming et al., 2020).

Refer to 'Example_climatology.m' to see usage examples.
